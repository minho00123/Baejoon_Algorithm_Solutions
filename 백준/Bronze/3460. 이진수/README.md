### 문제 설명

<p>Given a positive integer n, find the positions of all 1's in its binary representation. The position of the least significant bit is 0.</p>

<p>The positions of 1's in the binary representation of 13 are 0, 2, 3.</p>

<p>Write a program which for each data set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reads a positive integer n,</li>
	<li>computes the positions of 1's in the binary representation of n,</li>
	<li>writes the result</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to the number of data sets, 1 ≤ d ≤ 10. The sets follow.</p>

<p>Each data set consists of exactly one line containing exactly one integer n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output should consists of exactly d lines, one line for each data set.</p>

<p>Line i, 1 ≤ i ≤ d, should contain increasing sequence of integers separated by single spaces - the positions of 1's in the binary representation of the i-th input number.</p>
