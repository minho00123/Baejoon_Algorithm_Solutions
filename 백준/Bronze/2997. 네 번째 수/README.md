### 문제 설명

<p>Mirko has chosen four integers which form an arithmetic progression. In other words, when the four numbers are sorted, then the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is constant. </p>

<p>As has become usual, Mirko lost one of the numbers and also is not sure whether the remaining three are in the correct (sorted) order. </p>

<p>Write a program that, given the three remaining numbers, finds the fourth number.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input contains 3 integers between −100 and 100 on a single line, separated by single spaces. </p>

<p>Note: the input data will guarantee that a solution, although not necessarily unique, will always exist.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output any number which could have been the fourth number in the sequence. </p>
