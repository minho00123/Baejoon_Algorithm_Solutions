### 문제 설명

<p>The Avengers are looking for ways to improve their math skills, to better outsmart their many opponents. Captain America suggests the following problem. Given a number n between 1 and 12, find all the pairs of numbers between 1 and 12 that when summed produces n. For instance, given the number 5, two possible pairs of numbers are 1,4 and 2,3. Note that the two numbers in a pair must be different. I.e., 3,3 is not a legal pair.</p>

<p>To make the problem more challenging, the pairs must be presented in lexicographic order. I.e., two pairs of numbers are compared by their lowest number. For instance, 1,5 would come before 2,4 when sorted in lexicographic order.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line in the test data le contains the number of test cases (< 100). After that, each line contains one test case: the number n.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, you are to output in lexicographic order the different pairs of numbers between 1 and 12 that when summed produce n. If there are no such numbers, don't print anything.</p>
