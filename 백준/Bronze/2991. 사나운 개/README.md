### 문제 설명

<p>In a nearby village, the postman, milkman and garbage man face the same problem morning after morning: house 18. House 18 is guarded by two dogs that often cause problems. What they don't know is that the dogs' behaviour is completely predictable. </p>

<p>When the day starts, one dog is aggressive for A minutes and is then calm for B minutes. Similarly, the other dog is aggressive for C minutes, then calm for D minutes. Both dogs repeat their behaviours indefinitely, starting a new aggressive period after the calm period, then another calm period etc. </p>

<p>Given the arrival times of the postman, milkman and garbage man, determine how many dogs (none, one or both) attack each of them. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains the integers A, B, C and D. </p>

<p>The second line contains the integer P, M and G, the minute in the day during which the postman, milkman and garbage man arrive at house 18. For example, if P is 3, it should be interpreted as "the postman arrived sometime during the third minute in the day". </p>

<p>All numbers in the input will be between 1 and 999.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output should consist of three lines; each containing '2', '1' or '0', depending on how many dogs attack each of our heroes.</p>
