<p>Antonia and David are playing a game.</p>

<p>Each player starts with 100 points.</p>

<p>The game uses standard six-sided dice and is played in rounds. During one round, each player rolls one die. The player with the lower roll loses the number of points shown on the higher die. If both players roll the same number, no points are lost by either player.</p>

<p>Write a program to determine the final scores.</p>

### 입력

On each of the next n lines, will be two integers: the roll of Antonia for that round, followed by a space, followed by the roll of David for that round. Each roll will be an integer between 1 and 6 (inclusive)</p>

### 출력
