### 문제 설명

<p>Saruman the White and his underling, Grima Wormtongue, communicate with each other using a secret code, a language as twisted as their hearts. However, the Rangers are very clever, and they realize that reversing each message will reveal their adversary’s plotting. Aragorn has tasked you with decoding an archive of their messages.</p>

<p>Given a message on each line, output the decoded message.</p>

### 입력
