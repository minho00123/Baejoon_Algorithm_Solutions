### 문제 설명

<p>Given an integer value n (0 < n < 1000), followed by a list of integers, all of which are greater than 0 and less than 10000, report whether or not a given number in the list is a multiple of n (that is, n divides into that number without remainder at least one time). </p>

### 입력 

 <p>On the first line in the file is the value of which you are to find multiples. Following this, on a line by line basis, will be single integer values, each greater than 0 and less than 10000, which are to be examined as possible multiples of the first number. Input is terminated when a value of 0 is encountered. NOTE: There will be at least one nonzero value following the initial number in the file.</p>
