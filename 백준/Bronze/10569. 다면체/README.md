<p>Given a sphere, you can slice through the surface of the sphere to make different convex polyhedra. All of these convex polyhedra have the Euler characteristic which can be defined as follows:</p>

<p style="text-align:center">x = V − E + F = 2</p>

<p>where V represents the number of vertices, E the number of edges and F the number of faces on a convex polyhedron.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input begins with a line with a single integer T, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with two space-separated integers V and E (4 ≤ V, E ≤ 100), representing the number of vertices and edges respectively of the convex polyhedron.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print on a single line the number of faces in the defined polyhedron.</p>
